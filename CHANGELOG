N.B.: You *must* run

     ruby bundle
     rake upgrade_instiki

after installing the new software, to enjoy the benefits of this new version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.19.1

New Features:
* From the "All" or Category listings, you can export selected pages (in any
  desired order) to a single LaTeX file.
* LaTeX export supports \array{} (with no options) and a LaTeX-style optional
  argument for \sqrt[]{}. The latter requires itextomml 1.4.5 or later.
* Updated to itextomml 1.4.5 (a bunch of new itex language features).
* Updated to Rails 2.3.10. (There were security issues in 2.3.9 which, happily,
  did NOT affect Instiki 0.19. But 2.3.10 has other improvements, as well.)

Bugs Fixed:
* Several SVG-Edit bugs fixed.
* Removed some superfluous junk, to slim down the distribution (cuts the size of
  the compressed .tar.gz nearly in half).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.19

New Features:

* WYSIWYG SVG editing (via SVG-edit)
* One-click S5 templates
* Itex2MML is now a Rubygem. Latest is itextomml-1.4.2.

* Support IALs on Markdown list items
* Updated to Rails 2.3.9 and Erubis (now at 2.6.6)
* Updated for Rack 1.2.1, sqlite3-ruby 1.3.1
* Manages dependencies using Bundler. Before running Instiki for the first time
  (and whenever you update), run
  
     ruby bundle
     rake upgrade_instiki

  from the instiki directory. (You may need to run
  
     ruby bundle exec rake upgrade_instiki

  instead, if you get a complaint about your version of rake.)

Bugs Fixed:

* Works with Ruby 1.9.2
* Fixed a bug in non-Latin WikiWord processing. (Reported by Alexander Hambug)
* Fixed Cyrillic WikiWord support.
* More informative dnsbl lookup responses (suggested by Toby Bartels)
* Fixed a bug in LaTeX output
* No longer conflicts with sqlite3-ruby 1.3.x Rubygem
* Fixed some Category listing bugs
* Fixed an escaping bug in 'new' and 'edit' templates. (Reported by Toby Bartels)
* Allow special characters ('.', '/', etc) in page names.
* Fix BlahTeX/PNG path, so equations render in diff and
  previous revision pages.
* Fix HTML Export feature so that uploaded files are
  included, stylesheets load, etc.
* Uploaded files inclided in Markup Export.
* Fix Print View, so that uploaded images work.
* Fix some more Ruby 1.9 isues.
* Prevent page from being renamed to null.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.18.1

New Features:

* various syntax-colouring fixes
* Corrected length of wiki_references referenced_name (affects
  MySQL users)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.18

New Features:

* Syntax colouring: 'ansic', 'javascript', 'sqlite', 'yaml' and 'css' modes,
  in addition to the existing 'html', 'xml', and 'ruby' modes,
* Source view [suggested by Andrew Stacey]
* Auto-resizing Textareas scale to fit viewing area.
* Instiki upgraded to Rails 2.3.5 and Rack 1.1.
* Now runs on Ruby 1.9. (If you're a Passenger user, you may need to upgrade to Passenger
  2.2.8, which works around some bugs in Ruby 1.9.1.) 
* Upgraded for itex2MML 1.3.19 (which works under Ruby 1.9, and has several new feautures,
  relative to 1.3.15).

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a CSS bug, which screwed up printing (unless you used the "Print" view).
* Fixed a well-formedness bug in the page-name truncation algorithm [reported by Toby Bartels]
* Fixed a cache-sweeping bug [reported by Toby Bartels]
* Better accessibility.
* Improved log rotation under Passenger.
* Omit a (seemingly superfluous) javascript hack which causes Gecko-based browsers to request
     /my_wiki/s5/null
  when they load an s5 slideshow.
* Upgraded vendored sqlite3-ruby and rubyzip
* Move files when renaming a web (so that links to uploaded files don't break).
* Many Ruby 1.9 fixes, including removing the html5lib Sanitizer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.17.3

The most important facet of this release is a small change in the database
schema. Previously, people migrating from the default SQLite3 database to MySQL
ran the risk of silent data loss, because MySQL had a more strict interpretation
of the column types in the database. The new schema will prevent such problems.

     rake upgrade_instiki

will seamlessly upgrade your existing database to the new schema.

New Features:
* Passenger support (including X-Sendfile support, if the Apache mod_xsendfile
  module is installed).
* Update for itex2MML 1.3.13. (You should upgrade your itex2MML to the latest
  version, too.)

Bugs Fixed:
* Refactored the Web model (from James Herdman).
* Clean malformed utf-8 strings, rather than complaining about them.
* Updated location of Textile help, since _why_the_lucky_stiff left the 'net.
* Fixed a TeX rendering bug.
* Updated list of XHTML+MathML named entities to match W3C Working Draft.
* Refactored the Sanitizer (speedup).
* Fix S5 Slideshows for non-root Instiki URLs.
* Work around a Rails flash bug.
* Links from published webs should work right (finally?).
* An important database migration for MySQL users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.17.2

Security: Updated to Rails 2.3.4
* Fixes Timing Weakness in Rails MessageVerifier and the Cookie Store
  http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/4/timing-weakness-in-ruby-on-rails

  http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/4/xss-vulnerability-in-ruby-on-rails

New Features:
* Syntax colouring (`ruby` and `html`) for code blocks.

Bugs Fixed:
* Wikilinks to published webs should be to the published action. This didn't work
  right for inter-web links. (Reported by Mike Shulman)
* Use .size, rather than .length for ActiveRecord associations. A huge memory saving
  in building the recently_revised page.
* Refactor the upgrade_instiki rake task, to make it database-agnostic. (Many thanks to James Herdman)
* Web#files_path and Web#blatex_pngs_path now return Pathname objects. (Thanks, again, to James Herdman)
* Workaround for Mozilla Bug 449396. (Reported by Andrew Stacey)
* Correctly Set noindex,nofollow On /diff Pages.
* Page-renaming javascript deals correctly with page names containing ampersands, slashes, and other garbage.
* List of Wanted Pages should not include redirected pages.
* The Regexp, used in Maruku to detect "email" headers (used, e.g., for S5 slideshow metadata) could, for some inputs, interact badly with Instiki's Chunk Handler. Fixed.
* Ensure "rollback" locks page for editing.
* Generate relative URLs, when possible. (Patch by Dennis Knauf)
* Expire revisions of an edited page. Use a `before_save` hook to deal with the situation where a page's name has been changed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.17

New features:
* Ability to rename pages
* Ability to redirect Wikilinks, using
    [[!redirect ...]]
* HTTP 302 redirects, for redirected/renamed pages

Bugs Fixed:
* Rails gets very unhappy with "." in page or author names.
  Make sure that doesn't happen.
* Fix a Maruku escaping bug.
* WEBrick should respond to TERM signals 
  (needed by MacOSX and, perhaps, others).
* Add a flash message for redirection to "new" page
  when the target of "show" action is not found.

* More colour schemes: blue, brown, scarlet red, and plum.
  (From Jason Blevins)

  Link to it and to the "Diff" page from "Recently Revised".
  (from Jason Blevins)

New Features:
* Add x-sendfile support for downloading uploaded files in Instiki.
* Add support for HTML5 <video> and <audio> elements:
  [[mymovie.ogv:video]], [[mysound.wav:audio]].
* Runs on Rails 2.3.1
  
Bugs Fixed:
* Update to Rails 2.3.1, which fixes several bugs.
* Removed bundled Rack (Rails 2.3.1 comes bundled with Rack 1.0).
* Add config.action_view.cache_template_loading = true to production
  environment.
* Fix FastCGI bug
  (http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=24191&group_id=186 &atid=783).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.16.3: Big steps, Rails 2.3.0-RC1 and tons of new stuff!

All the patching, developing and great hacking from Jacques Distler was
merged into the main codebase of instiki. Jaques is now also maintaining the
main branch (together with parasew), which brings instiki up-to-date!

Find more information about all the changes in his site:

  http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/

New Features:
* Instiki comes and runs with Rails 2.3.0-RC1
* New Markdown interpreter: Maruku
* Default markup dialect is Markdown+itex2MML
* Mathematics suport, using itex2MML (Markdown+itex2MML)
     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html
  or BlahTeX (Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG)
     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/show/BlahTeX
* Theorem Environments
* Automatic Equation numbering and automatic Theorem numbering,
* Integrated presentation software
     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/show/S5
  complete with support for themes
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG)
* Sends application/xhtml+xml to compatible browsers
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG)
  Serve Webs which use non-Markdown Text Filters (Textile, RDoc or Mixed) as
  text/html. This makes those Text Filters usable, again.
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) enabled
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG).
* Nifty SVG Logo
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG).
* Atom 1.0 feeds.
* ETag support.
* Filesystem-based caching.
* New, industrial-strength Sanitizer (anti-XSS protection).
* Uses xhtmldiff for redline diff pages.
* (Actually functional) LaTeX output.
* InterWeb WikiLinks
* Add a user interface to manage uploaded files.
* Add a user interface to delete a Web.
* Add a user interface to delete orphaned pages in a Category. In addition to
  deleting all orphaned pages, you can now delete just the orphaned pages in a
  particular category. Among other things, this provides a handy way to delete
  a (selection of) page(s): just assign them to a new category (“delete”, say)
  and delete the orphaned pages in that category.
* Add the manage_fixtures plugin for easy database migration
* Descriptions in the File Upload Dialog are used as the default alt text (for
  pictures) or the default link text (for files).

Bugfixes:
(see http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001893.html for a
complete list)

* fixes to xhtmldiff
* fixed Sanitizer issues
* Do dnsbl lookups more judiciously. Anti-spam effectiveness is undiminished,
  but the application is more responsive.
* Fix a Session CookieOverflow when rescuing Instiki::ValidationError
* Domain independent caching
* Fix for no Flash Messages 
* Links on “published” Webs were all screwed-up. Fixed.
* Make uploaded pictures display in the “published” view.
* Make @import rules in the “Stylesheet Tweaks” work in the “published” view.
* Actually verify the password, when setting a password for a Web, rather than
  just pretending to do so.
* fixes for nowiki “<nowiki>[[!include foo]]</nowiki>”)
* Hide Equations From WikiChunk Processing
* Fix a bug in the Chunk handler, which was mangling backslashes in included
  pages.
* Entering the wrong password on the “CreateWeb” form now redirects back to
  the form, as it should.
* Allow single-letter WikiLinks (e.g. “[[a]]”). Requested by a Japanese user.
* Allow single-letter includes (e.g. “[[!include a]]”).
* Huge improvements to caching and cache-sweeping
* Category listing restricts to current Web.
* All WikiReference methods limit results to the current web
* File uploads work right.
* Make WEBrick respond to TERM signal. (Launchd, in particular, requires this.)
* Ditch the URIChunk and LocalURIChunk handlers. Slow, buggy, and of dubious
  utility.
* Ensure unsafe operations (new, save,...) are POSTs, not GETs.
* Fix utf-8 bug in WikiChunk handling.
* Disable WikiChunk processing in tags.
* Hide Equations From WikiChunk Processing
* Fix for the "Backslashes in Included Equations" bug.
* Sessions are now stored in a cookie (signed and Base-64 encoded).
  Form_spam_protection stores form_keys in the session.
  Make sure spambots implement both cookies and javascript, by storing
  hashed (with salt) keys in the session.
* Make sure request.ip is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
* Make remove_orphaned_pages work in a proxied situation.
* In the wiki_controller, only apply the dnsbl_check before_filter 
  to the :edit, :new, and :save :export actions, instead of all actions.
  This makes mundane "show" requests faster, but does not 
  compromise spam-fighting ability.
* Be a little gentler in recovering from Instiki::ValidationErrors, when
  saving a page. Previously, we threw away all the user's changes upon
  the redirect. Now we attempt to salvage what he wrote.
* Drop hostname from cache key.
* Fix Recursive Includes.
* Entering an incorrect password on the Create Web form should redirect
  back to the form, with a flash error.
* In the Stylesheet Tweaks, the owner of a Web can specify an @import rule
  to pull in CSS styles form an external file. This worked in the "show"
  view, but was broken in the "published" view. Fixed.
* Allow multiple leading capital letters in a WikiWord.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.13.0:

Mainly a Bugfix Release, which fixes two XSS Vulnerabilities.

 * 0.10.0:
   - Ported to ActionPack
   - RedCloth 3.0.3
   - BlueCloth is phased out, Markdown is rendered by RedCloth
   - Mix markup option understands both Textile and Markdown on the same page
   - Instiki can serve static content (such as HTML or plain-text files) from
     ./public directory

   - RSS feed with page contents for a password-protected web behaves as 
     follows: if the web is published, RSS feed links to the published version 
     of the web. otherwise, the feed is not available
     Madeleine will check every hour if there are new commands in the log or
     24 hours have passed since last snapshot, and take snapshot if either of

   - Wiki extracts (to HTML and plain text) will leave only the last extract
     file in ./storage
   - Wiki search handles multibyte (UTF-8) characters correctly

------------------------------------------------------------------------------          
 * 0.8.1:
   - Actually included RedCloth 2.0.7 in the release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------          
 * 0.8.0:
   - NOTE: Single-web wikis created in versions prior to 0.8.0 have "instiki"

     (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiClones,
     /show/HomePage, cgi.pl?show=WikiWord without escaping)
   - Accessing an unexisting page redirects to a different url (/new/PageName)
   - Increased snapshot time to just once a day (cuts down on disk storage
     requirements)
   - Made RDoc support work better with 1.8.1 [Mauricio Fern?ndez]
   - Added convinient redirect from /wiki/ to /wiki/show/HomePage
   - Fixed BlueCloth bug with backticks at start of line

------------------------------------------------------------------------------          
 * 0.7.0:
   - Added Markdown (BlueCloth) and RDoc [Mauricio Fern?ndez] as command-line 
     markup choices
   - Added wanted and orphan page lists to All pages (only show up if there's
